      <p> Early Warning mobileHealth screening and risk scoring application for preventing heath worker in-hospital transmission of Covid-19</p>
      <a href="#" class="btn">Full description</a>
      <p> This mobile application is designed to calculate a daily risk score for Covid-19 among health care workers providing care on non Covid-19 treatment units.</p>
      <p>The background of this is that health care workers (HCW) are at very high risk of contracting and transmitting covid-19. Secondly, it’s not feasible to perform daily or frequent swabs for the infection.</p>
      <p>As a result, we generate a daily risk score which bases on the health care workers symptoms and general well-being to assign a risk score. The risk score result is then used as a guide to recommend who should be prioritized to have a test. secondly if the staff’s risk is high based on their symptom score, appropriate intervention to minimize transmission to patients or other health care providers are instituted. The ultimate goal is therefore to make sure that staff on treatment units who develop covid-19 like symptoms are identified early to minimize in-hospital transmission of the infection.</p>
      <h3 id="benefits"> Nature of application</h3>
      <p>The application captures the daily symptoms of the participant based on the Covid-19 case definition as well as the contact history and then assigns are risk score. Very high-risk scores are indicative of a high likelihood of having the infection and hence warranting further analysis and infection transmission prevention. The participant risk score trends are also obtained which guide on their overall risk category but also used to obtain a general ward risk score. The application therefore assigns each health worker are safety certificate based on their risk score. Included in this application is the ability for the participant to upload their covid-19 test results and subsequently easily access a digital copy of the results when needed. </p>
      <p>This app therefore aims at reducing the transmission of Covid-19 on the treatment wards by identifying health care providers who have signs and symptoms similar to Covid-19 case definition thus enabling early intervention.</p>
